# Raspberry Pi Power Monitor

The Raspberry Pi Power Monitor is a combination of custom hardware and software that will allow you to monitor your unique power situation in real time (<0.5 second intervals), including accurate consumption, generation, and net-production. The data are stored to a database and displayed in a Grafana dashboard for monitoring and reporting purposes.

This project is derived from and inspired by the resources located at https://learn.openenergymonitor.org.

## What does it do?

This code accompanies DIY circuitry that supports monitoring of up to 6 current transformers and one AC voltage reading. The individual readings are then used in calculations to provide real data on consumption and generation, including the following key metrics:

* Total home consumption
* Total solar PV generation
* Net home consumption
* Net home generation
* Total current, voltage, power, and power factor values
* Individual current transformer readings
* Harmonics inspection through a built in snapshot/plotting mechanism.

The code takes tens of thousands of samples per second, corrects for phase errors in the measurements, calculates the instantaneous power for the tens of thousands of sampled points, and uses the instantaneous power calculations to determine real power, apparent power, and power factor. This means the project is able to monitor any type of load, including reactive, capacitive, and resisitve loads.
